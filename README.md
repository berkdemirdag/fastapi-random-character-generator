## Project Overview
This is a lightweight, REST API designed to generate random Dungeons & Dragons characters. 
I developed this tool as a learning exercise.
The goal was to create a functional API that handles data validation and follows a clear organizational pattern.

### Learning Objectives:
* **API Basics with FastAPI:** Setting up a POST endpoint and understanding how requests flow from a client to the server.
* **Project Structure:** Implementing a basic **Service Layer** to separate the character generation logic from the API routing for cleaner code.
* **Data Consistency:** Using **Pydantic** models to enforce data schemas and validate incoming requests.
