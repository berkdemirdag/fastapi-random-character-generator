## Project Overview
This is a lightweight, REST API designed to generate random Dungeons & Dragons characters. 

I built this project as a learning exercise.

### Key Learning Objectives:
* **FastAPI:** Implementing POST endpoints with asynchronous request handling.
* **Service Layer Pattern:** Separating business logic (character generation) from the API routing layer for better maintainability.
* **Data Schemas:** Using Pydantic models and Enums to strictly enforce character attributes (Race, Gender).
